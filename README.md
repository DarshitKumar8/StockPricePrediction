# Stock Price Prediction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Concepts Highlighted:
1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
2. Data cleaning is performed, including:
- Converting categorical data (likely the date) into numerical format (e.g., using timestamps).
- Transforming data types (e.g., converting "object" columns to numerical types like "int").
3. Feature Engineering:
- Converting the DataFrame into vectors and then into a matrix for model compatibility.
- Applying dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) to potentially improve model performance and reduce complexity.
4. Machine Learning Analysis:
- The data is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate a model.
- The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the unseen testing data.

### Skills Demonstrated:
1. Vectors and Matrices: Working with data represented as matrices.
2. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: Applying PCA to reduce features and identify key factors.
3. Data Analysis and Interpretation: Analyzing the principal components to understand relationships between stocks.
